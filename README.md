# OutRun

A small app built with HTML, CSS, JS to track your workouts.

It uses leaflet.js for the map component, OOP for creation of workouts and LocalStorage for storing the workouts locally on your machine.

!! Remember to allow the use of your location - otherwise nothing will work.

! It is not mobile friendly so don't even try it, it was not the purpose of this app.

All code (HTML, CSS, JS) was written by me, nothing from any tutorials.

## Usage

1 - allow usage of location
2 - click anywhere on the map to add a workout at that location
3 - a form will appear - you can select between Running and Cycling
4 - if you add at least 2 workouts a Filter/Sort section will appear. You can filter out Rides or Runs and you can sort by Distance or Duration.
5 - when you close the app, everything will be stored on your local storage. Come back and you'll still have your workouts there.
