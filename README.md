# OutRun

A small app built with HTML, CSS, JS to track your workouts.

It uses leaflet.js for the map component, OOP for creation of workouts and LocalStorage for storing the workouts locally on your machine.

!! Remember to allow the use of your location - otherwise nothing will work.

! It is not mobile friendly so don't even try it, it was not the purpose of this app.

All code (HTML, CSS, JS) was written by me, nothing from any tutorials.
